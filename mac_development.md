    ```bash
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```

3. Install git.

    ```cmd

    ```

4. Install core tools:

    ```cmd
    brew install cask docker python3 terraform
    brew cask install cakebrew visual-studio-code
    ```

## Installing additional tools

After following the instructions from the above, you should now have the **Cakebrew** app installed, which gives a friendly GUI on top of the Homebrew installer.

To install any additional programs, either open the **Cakebrew** app or copy-paste the below samples into a Terminal window. (You can also find additional packages at [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh).)

- `brew install awscli`
- `brew install azure-cli`
- `brew install elasticsearch`
- `brew install gradle`
- `brew cask install anaconda`
- `brew cask install dbeaver-community`

## Extra Credit: Create a GitHub Account

For extra credit, visit GitHub.com and register a new account. Once you've created a GitHub account and installed the core software, you are all all set to contribute to open source projects in GitHub, including this one!

- _Tip: We recommend a single account for both work and personal development projects._
